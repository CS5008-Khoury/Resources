# Course Resources

The following are a series of resources for the course. 

* [Resources](Resources.md) - Start Here, this provides access to the books for the course and a list of additional resources. Much of it you won't need until later in the semester, but good to start and make sure you have access to the resources.

* [InstallC](InstallC.md) - You will need to run the C installer for this course. Follow one of these recommendations. 

* [Technical Interview Questions](TechInterviewQuestions.md) - These are questions developed by past students to help with the question and answer portion of the technical interviews. They are technical focused questions aligning with the course modules. You are encouraged to practice them with your fellow classmates. 

* [Leet Code Practice](LeetCodePractice.md) - These are leet code questions selected by past students. You are encouraged to practice at least one leet code weekly to help you prepare for live coding activities, and further your understanding of data structures.
